# Burgers

## Assignment

Create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## Solution

Created an MVC design with separate model, views and controllers to handle the backend server logic.  ORM was used to handle building the SQL queries that will interact with the MySQL database.

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Node, Express, Handlebars, ORM, MySQL, Heroku, JawsDB.

## How to Use
Browse to the application hosted on [Heroku](https://burgers-sams.herokuapp.com/).  Enter a new burger by typing in a name and cliking the Add Burger button.  Devour a burger that has been created by clicking on the Devour! button.  Burgers are displayed in two sections, one for burgers that have not yet been devoured and another section for burgers that have been devoured.
